    print(f"Company: {result.company_extracted}")
    print(f"Location: {result.location}")
    print(f"Connections: {result.connections}")
    print(f"Bio: {result.description[:100]}...")

    print(f"Not found: {result.error}")
```

### Simple Query Search

```python
from linkedin_finder import find_linkedin_profile_simple

# Search using a simple query string
profile_url = find_linkedin_profile_simple("John Smith Microsoft")
print(profile_url)

## API Reference

### `LinkedInFinder`

Main class for finding LinkedIn profiles.

#### Constructor

```python
LinkedInFinder(
    delay_between_requests: float = 1.0,
    company_similarity_threshold: float = 0.6,
    name_similarity_threshold: float = 0.7
)
```

- `delay_between_requests`: Delay between search requests in seconds (default: 1.0)
- `company_similarity_threshold`: Minimum similarity score (0.0-1.0) for company matching (default: 0.6). Set to 0.0 to disable company validation
- `name_similarity_threshold`: Minimum similarity score (0.0-1.0) for name matching (default: 0.7). Validates that found profiles match the searched person's name to reduce false positives. Set to 0.0 to disable name validation

#### Methods

##### `search_profile(name: str, company: str = "", job_title: str = "") -> SearchResult`

Search for a LinkedIn profile using structured data.

- `name`: Person's name (required)
- `company`: Company name (optional)
- `job_title`: Job title (optional)

Returns a `SearchResult` object.

##### `search_simple(query: str) -> SearchResult`

Search using a simple query string (e.g., "John Smith Microsoft").

- `query`: Search query string

Returns a `SearchResult` object.

##### `search_multiple(searches: List[Dict], max_workers: int = 3) -> List[SearchResult]`

Search for multiple profiles in parallel.

- `searches`: List of dictionaries with 'name', 'company', 'job_title' keys
- `max_workers`: Number of parallel workers

Returns a list of `SearchResult` objects.

### `SearchResult`

Result object containing search results and extracted profile information.

#### Attributes

- `title: Optional[str]` - Profile title from search results
- `description: Optional[str]` - Full profile description/bio from search results

- `company_extracted: Optional[str]` - Extracted company name
- `name_extracted: Optional[str]` - Extracted person name from profile (used for validation)
- `query_used: Optional[str]` - The search query that worked
- `strategy: Optional[int]` - Which search strategy succeeded
- `error: Optional[str]` - Error message if search failed

### Convenience Functions

#### `find_linkedin_profile(name: str, company: str = "", job_title: str = "") -> Optional[str]`

Simple function that returns just the profile URL or None.

#### `find_linkedin_profile_simple(query: str) -> Optional[str]`

Simple function for query-based search that returns just the profile URL or None.

## Examples

### Basic Usage with Rich Profile Data

```python
from linkedin_finder import LinkedInFinder

# Initialize with company validation
finder = LinkedInFinder(company_similarity_threshold=0.6)

# Search for someone
result = finder.search_profile("Satya Nadella", "Microsoft")
if result.success:
    print(f"Found: {result.profile_url}")
    print(f"Job Title: {result.job_title_extracted}")
    print(f"Company: {result.company_extracted}")
    print(f"Location: {result.location}")
    print(f"Connections: {result.connections}")
else:
    print("Profile not found")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from linkedin_finder import LinkedInFinder

finder = LinkedInFinder()

# Search for multiple people
searches = [
    {"name": "John Smith", "company": "Microsoft"},
    {"name": "Jane Doe", "company": "Google"},
    {"name": "Bob Johnson", "company": "Apple"},
]

results = finder.search_multiple(searches, max_workers=3)

for i, result in enumerate(results):
    if result.success:
        print(f"Found {searches[i]['name']}: {result.profile_url}")
    else:
        print(f"Not found: {searches[i]['name']}")
```

### Command Line Examples

```bash
# Find a specific person
linkedin-finder "Elon Musk Tesla"

# Find with separate parameters
linkedin-finder "Tim Cook" --company "Apple"

# Find with job title
linkedin-finder "Sundar Pichai" --company "Google" --job-title "CEO"

# Use in scripts
PROFILE=$(linkedin-finder "John Smith Microsoft")
echo "Found profile: $PROFILE"
```

## Configuration

### Company Validation

The package includes smart company validation to ensure profile accuracy:

```python
# Strict company matching (default: 0.6)
finder = LinkedInFinder(company_similarity_threshold=0.8)

# Moderate company matching
finder = LinkedInFinder(company_similarity_threshold=0.4)

# Disable company validation
finder = LinkedInFinder(company_similarity_threshold=0.0)
```

**How Company Validation Works:**
- When you specify a company, the system validates that found profiles actually work at that company
- Profiles without clear company information are rejected when company validation is enabled
- This prevents returning wrong people with the same name but different employers
- Company names are normalized (removes "Inc.", "LLC", etc.) for better matching

**Example:**
```python
# This will reject profiles that don't clearly show "Apple" as the company
result = finder.search_profile("Tim Cook", "Apple")
if not result.success:
    print("No Apple employee named Tim Cook found")
    # This is better than returning a random Tim Cook!
```

### Rate Limiting

The package includes built-in rate limiting to be respectful to search engines. You can adjust the delay:

```python
finder = LinkedInFinder(delay_between_requests=2.0)  # 2 second delay
```

### Logging

Enable verbose logging to see search progress and company validation:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Use DEBUG to see company matching

finder = LinkedInFinder()
result = finder.search_profile("John Smith", "Microsoft")
```

## Rich Profile Information

The package extracts comprehensive profile information from search results:

### Available Profile Data

- **Job Title**: Current position (e.g., "CEO", "Software Engineer", "Marketing Director")
- **Company**: Current employer with smart normalization
- **Location**: Geographic location (city/region)
- **Connections**: Network size (e.g., "500+ connections")
- **Bio/Description**: Profile summary and mission statements
- **Profile URL**: Direct link to LinkedIn profile

### Example Output

```python
result = finder.search_profile("Satya Nadella", "Microsoft")
if result.success:
    print(f"URL: {result.profile_url}")
    print(f"Job Title: {result.job_title_extracted}")        # "Chairman and CEO"
    print(f"Company: {result.company_extracted}")            # "Microsoft"
    print(f"Location: {result.location}")                    # "Redmond"
    print(f"Connections: {result.connections}")              # "500+ connections"
    print(f"Bio: {result.description[:100]}...")             # "As chairman and CEO of Microsoft..."
```

### Information Extraction Process

1. **Search Results Analysis**: Parses title and description from search engines
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Uses regex patterns to identify job titles, companies, locations
3. **Data Normalization**: Cleans and standardizes extracted information
4. **Validation**: Ensures extracted data meets quality standards

## Dependencies

- `ddgs>=3.0.0` - DuckDuckGo search library for web searches
- `tqdm` - Progress bars for batch operations
